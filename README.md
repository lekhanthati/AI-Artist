# GenAI-Artist

## Objective:

Devlop an advaced algorithm that is able to generate human faces without any help or human intervention. The primary goal is to leverage the Generative AI techniques and Tensorflow to develop a effictive algorithm that can outout accurate images which are hard to distinguish.

## Output 

## Working with Image data 

When it comes to image data, Machine Learning Algorithms can directly interpret image data as our brains do. But this is possible by converting images into numerical representation. There are different Libraries and Frameworks helps to deal with image preprocessing like OpenCV.
Today we are checking out application of Generative AI with image data. There are to parts for the algorithm 
1)	Generator
2)	Discriminator
The details are mentioned below
